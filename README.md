# __Welcome to Adopt Me Right Meow__

[Link to Heroku!](https://adopt-me-right-meow.herokuapp.com/)

***
Come look at all the wonderful cats! These cats are up for adoption at an imaginary shelter.

## Log in
Users do not have to log in to view cats! However if you want to adopt a cat you must be logged in to do so.

## Payment
Payment for cats is very important to us as it is what we use to keep the cats healthy and happy. To purchase a cat simply click on the "Adopt Me" button that is next to every cat. Once clicked on, the button will redirect you to a page that will allow you to pay for your cat.

Payment is through Stripe and is secure.

## Admins
Admins have the ability to add more cats to the page! They can do this through entering in a cat information through forms in the "Admin" tab, or, in the same tab, they can upload a .csv file with the correct fields and our application will import their cats automatically!

Additional Admin functionality is the deletion of cats. Once and cat has been adopted, and admin can remove it from the page so that users do not view cats that have already been adopted.

  Things that may be of interest are:
    * Cat Controller - this is the cornerstone for all things cat!
    * Email Controller - the center for sending out those emails.
    * send_email.rake - making sure your emails are being sent on time.
    * Specs - testing is very important to us.
    * Cat Model - this is where Admins can upload csv files and excel files to the app. Worth a look!
